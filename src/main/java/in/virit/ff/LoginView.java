        This app impersonates you in booking.finferries.fi and gives you a better UX. If you choose to 
        use this app, you should be aware that it is not an official app, and it is not endorsed by Finferries.
        Also you must accept the terms of the booking site. Also note that this app can easily break if
        the booking site changes. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not use this app.
        
        The app needs your username and password to work. The credentials are stored in your browser's local storage,
        and during the session, they are used to log in to the booking site. Note, that if I would be evil, I could
        steal your credentials by changing the source code ðŸ§¸ The source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mstahv/ffs/).
